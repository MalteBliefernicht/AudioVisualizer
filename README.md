# AudioVisualizer

The purpose of this project was not to create a useful audioplayer, but to learn something about visualizing audio.
The functions of the player are therefore very limited. Mainly only single audio files can be loaded.
The visualizer in its current state works quite well, but has a major disadvantage.
Most of the computation happens when opening the audio file. The result are some serious loading times of up to several seconds.
Maybe I will revisit this project at a later date, when my capabilities as a programmer have improved.
